## üöÄ Overview

A web platform that enables citizens across India to anonymously report infrastructure issues like potholes, broken streetlights, water leaks, and poor drainage. Reports are displayed on an interactive map with intelligent clustering, go through a moderation system, and are automatically shared on social media with relevant state authorities tagged.

### Key Features

- **Anonymous Reporting**: No account required - citizens can report issues instantly
- **Interactive Map**: OpenStreetMap integration with smart clustering based on zoom level
- **Photo Upload**: EXIF GPS extraction and automated image moderation
- **Status Tracking**: Real-time updates from submission to resolution
- **Social Integration**: Automatic Twitter posting with state authority mentions
- **Multi-language**: Hindi and English support with extensible i18n framework
- **Admin Dashboard**: Comprehensive moderation and management interface

## üåü Use Cases
